        <p>Salon 99 is on a mission—to offer hair services and products in a welcoming environment, with a focus
          on promoting and supporting inclusion and the well-being of our customers, employees and community.</p>
        <br>
        <p>More than 5 years ago, I envisioned a hair salon inspired by hair and its rare, explosively visual
          fabulousness. I wanted our salon to be like that also, a place where everyone feels they can come to be seen
          and supported while expressing their unique identity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, that original vision has shifted, pushed to change by listening to the voices that most matter: yours.
          We have pivoted to focus on all colors, all waves and curls and coils, all voices and people, creating a sea
          of colors and waves as our visual power. Our expert stylists still give customers personal attention in our
          boutique salons, while also—just as importantly—protecting people’s hearts and bodies. Come join us in our
          ever-evolving movement
          towards creating positive change in the salon industry!</p>
